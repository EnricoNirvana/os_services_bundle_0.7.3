PHP Component Setup:
====================

For the easiest installation, move or upload the 'os_services' folder to the webroot of your http server.  This location may be defined as one of the following based on your server environment:

- /www (AMP stacks like XAMPP, WampServer, etc)

- /var/www/html (Linux/Apache)
 
- /var/www/htdocs (Linux/Apache)

- /Library/WebServer/Documents (Mac OS X)

- /inetpub/wwwroot (Microsoft IIS server)

- /home/<user>/public_html (Linux/Apache: shared server)


Grant sufficient access priveleges to all folders/files: 

- 'read/write' for owner and group

- 'read only' for everyone elss

- this would be a CHMOD value of 775
