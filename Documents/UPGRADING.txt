Upgrading from a previous version:
=====================================

For users who already have the previous version of the services bundle installed and would like to upgrade to the current version, it's relatively painless - especially if you installed everything using the default values suggested in the documentation.  Here are the steps you should take:

1. Backup your existing components -just in case-

- your 'os_services' folder in your webroot

- the 'OpenSimProfile.Modules.dll' and 'OpenSimSearch.Modules.dll' in your OpenSim /bin folder

- your 'os_services' database

(In case you need to make changes to them, back up the following as well)

- your 'OpenSim.ini', 'StandaloneCommon.ini' -or- 'GridCommon.ini' and 'Robust/Robust.HG.ini' files.


2. Replace the old 'os_services' web directory with the new one and make sure you assign the same permissions as before:

- Read/Write' for Owner and Group

- Read Only for everyone else 

- or CHMOD 775

[NOTE] This version of the bundle is designed to use a single configuration file for all services but reflects the SAME suggested installation paths as previous versions which utilized separate config files for each service.


3. Replace your existing Profile and Search DLLs (located in your OpenSim /bin directory) with the ones found in the 'For OpenSim server' folder.


4. Update your database.  This can be done by IMPORTING the 'services_update.sql' file in the 'For MySQL server > Update ONLY' folder into your existing 'os_services' database.  It should update some of the existing tables without altering your stored data.  Nonetheless, make that backup copy.

Otherwise, you can always start with a fresh database, IMPORT the 'services_all.sql' and restore your OpenSim data from backups.
