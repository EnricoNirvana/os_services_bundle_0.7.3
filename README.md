os_services_bundle_0.7.3
========================

** This version of the OS Services Bundle is compatible with OpenSim 0.7.3 ONLY **

This is an ongoing attempt at creating bundled installation packages for OpenSim modules which are not part of the core distribution but provide what many consider to be essential or highly desired services.  

This bundle contains everything needed to set up and run Groups, Profiles, Search and Offline Messages services with your 
current OpenSim instance(s) including binaries, web components, database dumps and step by step instructions.  The web component has been consolidated into a single folder with 1 config file.

While in certain situations not every function will perform flawlessly, it's a reasonable starting point from which most users can establish a solid, feature-rich OpenSim server with as little stress and confusion as possible.
