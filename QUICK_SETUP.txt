A quick setup guide:
====================


Step 1 - Database Setup:
=======================

- Create a new MySQL database with a collation scheme of 'latin1_general_ci'.

- Import the file named 'services_all.sql' located in the 'MySql_files' folder.

- Make sure to select 'latin1_general_ci' or 'iso-8859-1' as the character set of the source file if that option is available.



Step 2 - PHP Component Setup:
=============================

- Move/upload the 'os_services' folder located in the 'Web_files' folder within the webroot of your http server.

- This location is where publicly accessible web pages are located and may be defined as follows based on your server environment:

   /www (AMP stacks like XAMPP, WampServer, etc)

   /var/www/html (Linux/Apache)
 
   /var/www/htdocs (Linux/Apache)

   /Library/WebServer/Documents (Mac OS X)

   /inetpub/wwwroot (Microsoft IIS server)

   /home/<user>/public_html (Linux/Apache: shared server)


- Grant sufficient access privileges to all folders/files:

   'read/write' for owner and group

   'read only' for everyone

   (this would be a CHMOD value of 775)


- Open the 'config.php' file in a text editor and modify the settings for your database host, name, user and password to suit your specific environment.  Be sure to read the comments for suggestions and help.

- If you want to add extra security to your Groups service, define a pair of access keys under 'Group Security' and add those to the [Groups] section of your 'OpenSim.ini' file.



Step 3 - Binary Component Setup:
================================

- Find the 2 files named 'OpenSimProfile.Modules.dll' and 'OpenSimSearch.Modules.dll' in the 'OpenSim_files' folder of this distribution.

- Move/upload them to the root directory of your OpenSim instance (usually the 'bin' folder or wherever your OpenSim executables and DLLs reside).



Step 4 - OpenSim Config Files Setup:
====================================

** NOTE **

The web paths suggested in the following steps assume you are running your web server on the default http port (80).  If you are using a non-standard port, please add this to the 'your_host' portion of the string - <your_host:port_number> or <127.0.0.1:8080> as an example.


A. Groups
---------

- To enable the Groups service MODIFY the following lines in your 'OpenSim.ini' file (this applies to both standalone and grid modes):

[Groups]

    Enabled = true

    Module = GroupsModule

    MessagingEnabled = true

    MessagingModule = GroupsMessagingModule

    ServicesConnectorModule = XmlRpcGroupsServicesConnector

    GroupsServerURI = "http://<your_host>/os_services/xmlrpc.php"

    NoticesEnabled = true

    DebugEnabled = false

    (these should match the keys you defined in the 'config.php' file from the Groups web service folder)

    XmlRpcServiceReadKey    = xxxx
    XmlRpcServiceWriteKey   = xxxx



B. Offline Messages
-------------------

- To enable Offline Messages MODIFY the following lines in your 'OpenSim.ini' file (this applies to both STANDALONE and GRID modes):


[Messaging]

    OfflineMessageModule = OfflineMessageModule

    OfflineMessageURL = http://<your_host>/os_services/offline.php

    MuteListModule = MuteListModule

    ** Not currently used, but MUST be set to allow offline messaging to work **

    MuteListURL = http://<your_host>/os_services/mute.php

    ForwardOfflineGroupMessages = true


- Additionally, if you're running in GRID mode with HYPERGRID enabled, change the following lines in your 'Robust.HG.ini' file to allow offline messages from users on other grids to be saved and delivered:


[Messaging]

    OfflineMessageURL = http://<your_host>/os_services/offline.php

    ForwardOfflineGroupMessages = true




C. Profiles
-----------

The following settings are the bare minimum needed to activate the Profiles module.


- STANDALONE mode: ADD the following new section to your 'StandaloneCommon.ini' file:


    [Profile]

        Module = "OpenProfileModule"

        ProfileURL = http://<your_host>/os_services/profile.php



    Also, MODIFY the following line in the same file:


    [LoginService]

        SRV_ProfileServerURI = "http://<your_host>/os_services/profile.php"



- GRID mode: ADD the following section to your 'GridCommon.ini' file.


    [Profile]

        Module = "OpenProfileModule"


        ProfileURL = http://<your_host>/os_services/profile.php



Also, MODIFY the following line in your 'Robust.HG.ini' file:


    [LoginService]

        SRV_ProfileServerURI = "http://<your host>/os_services/profile.php"




D. Search
---------

- To enable the Search module ADD the following new section to your 'OpenSim.ini' file:


    [Search]

        SearchURL = http://<your host>/os_services/query.php


- OPTIONAL: If you want certain elements of your sim(s) (other than people, groups and classifieds) to be indexed for searching you'll need to MODIFY the following lines in the same file:


[DataSnapshot]

    index_sims = true

    gridname = "<your_grid_name>"

    data_services="http://<your_host>/os_services/register.php"

(the other variables in this section can be modified once you become more familiar with the indexing function)


- Next, ADD the following lines to the [Modules] section of either your 'StandaloneCommon.ini' or 'GridCommon.ini' file depending on which architecture your OpenSim instance is running:


    [Modules]

        LandServices = "RemoteLandServiceConnector"

        LandServiceInConnector = "true"


** NOTE **  

Your grid/regions need to be regularly inspected by the Data Snapshot Module in order to fill the database with up to date information about new and pre-existing searchable items.  This is accomplished by running the 'parser.php' script on a regular basis.  The easiest way to do this is to create a cron job (unix) or scheduled task (win/mac) to execute the parser.php script as a background task.

Setting up cron jobs/scheduled tasks is beyond the scope of this guide, but there are several tutorials available on the interwebs.
